                            <p class="p5a">The first main point I found was the issues with misdiagnosis and implications about it including damaging patients physically, mentally and in many cases doing it to exploit them for money. From the interviews conducted I found in both cases that they were both originally misdiagnosed many times. In the first case the patient had to come in over and over even though the doctors knew exactly the diagnoses of the patient but continued to exploit them because for each visit they came to they made money. This causes immense mental damage to the patient and physically damages the patient to the point where portions of their brain die and put them in a huge danger not only to themselves but also others around them. In the second interview the patient was misdiagnosed multiple times and also had to go to many different doctors and even then they had to fight for their diagnoses and if they did not the patient would have died the same day. This happened for the same reasons and also caused both mental and physical damage to the patient.</p>

                            <p>The second thing I found out about the issues with the nz medical system is the issues with medicine / medical drugs. The first thing I have found is issues with the prices of medication, some People are not able to afford the prices of the medication or medical items that keep them alive and in some cases patients have to result to bankruptcy and in very extreme cases people die - with the inclusion of the mental damage going through the medical system causes it is very hard for patients to find the money or work hard enough to get money from other places. The second issue that I found is that sometimes Medication is not being made properly and/or has limited testing leaving in some cases patients dead and many in grave danger. They also have a large lack of communication with patients telling them the risks with certain medication. Some people are also exploited for very risky clinical trials but are put in a position that they have no other choice.  </p>

                            <p>The third main point I found from my research was the issues about mental health and how it was affected by the medical system. I found that the system has very limited mental health help offered. This is bad because it is found that going through the system of having some sort of sickness almost definitely causes mental health issues as well as the issues with the doctors directly contributing to causing mental health issues. I found that patients are not offered, encouraged or informed almost at all to get or receive help with their mental health with things including therapy or other ways to help. I also found that there is no funding for mental health options meaning if people want it they have to find it themselves and then pay for it. This wouldn't be such an issue however going through the medical system affects more than just the sick person, it also affects the people around them including close friends and family meaning it will be very expensive and difficult to find and pay for help for many people.</p>
